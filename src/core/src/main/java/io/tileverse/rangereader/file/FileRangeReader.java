/**
 * A thread-safe file-based implementation of {@link RangeReader} that provides efficient random access to local files.
 *
 * <p>This implementation uses NIO {@link FileChannel} with position-based reads ({@link FileChannel#read(ByteBuffer, long)})
 * to ensure thread safety. Unlike traditional stream-based file access, position-based reads allow multiple threads
 * to read from different parts of the same file concurrently without interference, as each read operation specifies
 * its absolute position in the file.
 *
 * <h2>Thread Safety</h2>
 * <p>This class is fully thread-safe for concurrent read operations. The underlying {@link FileChannel} supports
 * simultaneous reads from multiple threads as long as each operation uses absolute positioning, which this
 * implementation guarantees.
 *
 * <h2>Performance Characteristics</h2>
 * <p>FileRangeReader provides excellent performance for random access patterns typical in tiled data access:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Zero-copy operations where possible through direct ByteBuffer usage</li>
 * <li>Efficient random access without seek overhead</li>
 * <li>OS-level caching benefits for frequently accessed file regions</li>
 * <li>No synchronization overhead between concurrent read operations</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Usage Example</h2>
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Create reader for a PMTiles file
 * Path pmtilesFile = Paths.get("data/world.pmtiles");
 * try (FileRangeReader reader = FileRangeReader.of(pmtilesFile)) {
 *     // Read tile data from different threads concurrently
 *     ByteBuffer tileData = reader.readRange(offset, length);
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * @see FileChannel#read(ByteBuffer, long)
